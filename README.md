# ZELDA-COMBIN
Redshift-Electromagnetic Localisation Deducation Algorithm


TO-BE-UPDATED WITH SOURCE CODE, SETTINGS, AND INSTRUCTIONS

Pre-requisites

Simulated Binaries:

Binary simulation outputs that conform to the REAPER_Template: REAPER_template.txt, please ensure all fields are filled.

Required Fields:
- 3D Systematic Velocity of the system following kicks
- Primary ZAMS mass
- Age at First/Second Supernova
- Inspiral Time


Cosmological Simulation - EAGLE Simulation:

Refer to the attached SQL queries - scripts require login access to the database, see relevant fields in the script. Please visit http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle/database.php to create an account. 

## To-Do List
- Add scripts for creating required directories
- Add scripts for translating binaries to REAPER format
- Add scripts for downloading EAGLE data
- Add settings file for initalising variables and storing EAGLE login
- Add core zELDA functionality

Note: I want to apologise for the delay in getting this repository filled. Following the completion of my PhD, I jumped straight into a new position and haven't had time to actively collate the required files. I am aiming to have a fully functional zELDA pipeline ready for you to use by the end of 2023.
